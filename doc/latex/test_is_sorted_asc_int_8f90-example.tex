\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
In prior versions of this function, an interger was returns instread of a logical. If the vector was not sorted, than the interger would indicate the position of the first two pairwise elements where one element was larger than the following element. This proved to not be useful and was taken out. If need for this functionally is determined in the future, than it has been decided that it will be implimented in a different function, most likely wrapped in the same interface.

An empty vector is considered sorted.

This algorithm requires at most N -\/ 1 compares.
